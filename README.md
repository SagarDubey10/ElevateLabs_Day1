Python CLI Calculator
This repository contains a simple command-line interface (CLI) calculator application built in Python. This project was completed as part of the Elevate Labs Python Developer Internship Task 1.

Features:
Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
User-Friendly CLI: The application interacts with the user via the terminal, prompting for input and displaying results.
Continuous Operation: The calculator runs in a loop, allowing for multiple calculations until the user chooses to exit.

Code Structure:
The project consists of a single Python script, calculator.py.
Each arithmetic operation is handled by a separate function (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
The main application logic is contained within a loop to handle continuous user input.
The script includes error handling for invalid input and division by zero.
